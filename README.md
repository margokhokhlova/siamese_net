# siamese_net
The code for my implementation of siamese networks applied to geo data. 
The model is implemented using Keras, the architecture is shown below.

The architecture is based on classical seiamese netwroks implementations (see Keras siamese Demo), but modified for my custom data pairs and early fusion.
